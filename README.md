App that allows students to send lecturers questions in real time in class. Part of a college app development project for 3rd year Computer
Engineers. The Firebase API is used to allow instant cloud messaging between the lecturer and student. Each module that a lecturer teaches is
added as a chatroom, where students on the class list for that module can join.
